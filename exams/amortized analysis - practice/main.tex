    Consider the amortized analysis of the dynamic array problem.

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item (1pt) Apply the accounting method to simulate the bank account balance over 10 operations considering that:
            \[
                \hat{c}_{i} =
                \begin{cases}
                    \$2.00, & \text{$i$ = 1}.\\
                    \$3.00, & \text{otherwise}.
                \end{cases}
            \]
        \item (4pts) Use the potential function $\Phi_{i} = 2i - 2^{\lceil log(i) \rceil}$ to calculate the amortized operation cost $\hat{c}_{i}$ assuming that:
            \[
                c_{i} =
                \begin{cases}
                    i, & \text{if $i-1$ is power of $2$}.\\
                    1, & \text{otherwise}.
                \end{cases}
            \]
    \end{enumerate}

    Remember to explain with detail your procedure and that $\hat{c}_{i} = c_{i} + \Delta\Phi_{i} $

\begin{problem}{Outcomes a}{5}
    Evaluate the following expressions using Master Method. If the Master Method can't be applied explain the reason.

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item $T(n) = 20T(n/6) - n^{2}log(n)$
        \item $T(n) = 4T(n/2) + \frac{n}{log(n)}$
        \item $T(n) = 6T(n/3) + n^{2}log(n)$
        \item $T(n) = \sqrt{2}T(n/2) + log(n)$
        \item $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + nlog(n)$
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}{Outcomes a}{4}
    Consider a binary counter algorithm that counts from 0 to n using binary representation. Find an upper bound on the total worst-case running time (1pt), then calculate the amortized cost of each operation using one of the methods presented in class (3pts). Explain your procedure.

\begin{problem}{Outcomes a}{2}
    Given $T(n) = 4T(n/3) + n$ prove using substitution method that the solution for this recurrence is $O(n^{log_3 4})$

\begin{problem}{Outcomes a}{4}
    Write a divide-and-conquer c++ algorithm (3pts) that receives and array of $n$ strings and returns the largest prefix of all strings in the array. For example if the array is \{``dog", ``doggie", ``dogs"\} then the largest prefix is ``dog". If there isn't a common prefix between all words return an empty string. After that, write the execution time of your algorithm (1pt)
